1. Run following command for basic typescript code setup: 
	- npm init
	- npm install typescript nodemon ts-nodemon

2. Initilize the typescript with one of the commands below:
	- tsc --init

3. To compile typescript file: 
	- Compile one file to JS: tsc filename.ts
	- Compile all files to JS: tsc

4. Run the compiled JS file in normal way: 
	- node filename.js




- NOTE: 
	- Delete the "tsc.ps1" file if the 'tsc' command doesn't work: 
		- "tsc.ps1" Path: C:\Users%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\npm\tsc.ps1

	- Typescript was made by Microsoft, so it is some what combination of C# and JavaScript.
	- When there is error in Typescript code, it will show errors but also continue compiling that code into JS
		- We can't stop typescript from not compiling the error-ful code, it can only show warnings

	- "tsconfig.json" NOTE:
		- This file can tell in which platform oru app runs (Browser, OS, etc.)
		- We can set the output compiled directory (Eg: To 'dist' folder)
		- We can use 'sourceMap' property to direct the Browser to '.ts' file during error instead of '.js' file
